How works of a basic servo motor?
Internal schematic of a servo motor
A DC motor is connected to a potentiometer and an electronic circuit.
This connection allows the speed of the motor to be adjusted according to the position of the potentiometer. 
Gears are attached to the motorâ€™s output shaft to increase torque and reduce speed. As the motor runs, the gears move the main shaft that holds the potentiometer. 
If the motor stops, the electronic circuitry will automatically adjust the speed so that the arm and potentiometer remain in the same place. 
This benefits robot arms that must be sustained in a particular position and not drop due to gravity when the movement stops.
